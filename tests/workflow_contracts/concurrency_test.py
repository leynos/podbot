"""Contracts cancelling superseded pull-request runs.

Every push to a pull request starts a fresh run of each gate, and the run
already in flight is answering a question about a commit nobody will merge.
Left alone it holds a runner until it finishes, so the branch pays twice for
one answer. A concurrency group keyed on the pull request makes the newer run
cancel the older one.

Cancellation has to stay conditioned on the event. A literal
``cancel-in-progress: true`` would also cancel a push to `main`, a schedule,
and a dispatch, none of which has a successor waiting: the run that writes the
warm cache on `main` would be killed by the next merge, and the coverage
history would gain holes. The condition is therefore part of the contract, not
an implementation detail, and `test_cancellation_is_conditioned_on_the_event`
fails on the literal.

The group also has to distinguish one pull request from another. A group
derived from ``github.run_id`` is unique per run and so cancels nothing, while
a constant group would let one branch cancel another's gates.

Only `pull_request` is in scope. A `pull_request_target` workflow runs against
the base repository to carry a token, and the workflows that use it here automate
pull-request housekeeping rather than build; cancelling an auto-merge
mid-flight is a hazard with no minutes to win.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
